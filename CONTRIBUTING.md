## Development Guidelines

To ensure the codebase remains consistent, high-quality, and easy to maintain, please follow these guidelines.

### Code Style and Formatting

  - **C++ Best Practices**: Adhere to idiomatic C++ and maintain high code quality.
  - **Maintain ImGui/ImPlot3D Style**: Ensure new code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase's style and API patterns.
  - **Formatting**: Use **`clang-format`** to format your code before committing. This ensures a consistent style across the entire project.

### Commit Messages

Follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** specification to maintain a clear and informative git history. Each commit message should be prefixed with a type, such as `feat:`, `fix:`, or `docs:`.

**Commit Types:**

  - **feat**: A new feature.
  - **fix**: A bug fix.
  - **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
  - **docs**: Documentation only changes.
  - **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., `clang-format`).
  - **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
  - **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.
  - **merge**: Merging branches or pull requests.

**Examples:**

```
feat: add support for plotting 3D scatter plots
fix: correct rendering issue with large datasets
docs: update installation instructions
style: apply clang-format to codebase
refactor: restructure internal data handling for performance
test: add unit tests for plot data validation
chore: update ImGui dependency to latest version
```

### Documentation and Demos

  - **Public APIs**: All new public APIs should be clearly documented with comments in the header files.
  - **Complex Logic**: Add comments to explain any complex or non-obvious implementation details.
  - **Demos**: When you add a new feature, please include a demonstration in `implot3d_demo.cpp` to showcase its usage.
